# Risk Assessment Cybersecurity Project

This repository contains the risk assessment project focused on identifying, evaluating, and mitigating potential security risks in the information systems of a microbiology laboratory.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to conduct a thorough risk analysis of the microbiology lab's information systems,ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Key objectives include:
- Identifying critical assets and their vulnerabilities
- Assessing potential threats to these assets, considering both internal and external risks.
- Proposing effective countermeasures to enhance overall security and compliance.
- Ensuring adherence to cybersecurity best practices and regulatory requirements.

## Methodology
The analysis follows the **ISO27k risk assessment framework**, incorporating:
- **Asset Valuation**: Identifying and prioritizing key information assets.
- **Risk Analysis**: Assessing the likelihood and impact of potential threats.
- **Countermeasure Proposal**: Recommending specific security measures.
